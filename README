This is an Add-On for thunderbird and / SeaMonkey that add a dropdown menu to the format toolbar inside the compose window,
to quickly highlight the current selection.
Standard colours are configured: yellow, cyan, green, pink, red, and also light and dark grey.
The current version is basic, but should be sufficient for the majority of users.
Once you have chosen an highlight colour in the drop down menu, you can just click on the button again to use the last colour.

To remove the highlight state of a block, simply click inside the block, and select clear from the dropdown menu. To remove the highlight state of many blocks at once, select the block that contains all highlighted elements, and select the clear entry in the drop down.
